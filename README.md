# Introduction
This is the repo for the ML project that I am working on as part of the [Machine Learning course at Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/courses/ai-machine-learning-career-track).

#Datasets explored for the project
**Chest X-Ray Covid-19 & Pneumonia**
This is a dataset of chest x-ray images with labels that identify covid-19 and pneumonia. The deep learning network could be trained to classify if a given x-ray image is of a patient with covid-19 or pneumonia or a normal person. Here is the information on Kaggle

**Turbofan jet engine dataset degradation detection**
This is a dataset that was generated using a simulator. The data was collected by simulating a jet engine run continiously till failure. The goal is to build a model that will predict the remaining number of cycles based on the sensor readings.

**Amazon reviews for sentiment analysis**
This is a dataset that has reviews written by users with a label on wether it is a postive or negative review. The goal is to train a model that can predict predict the postive or negative sentiment for a given review text.
